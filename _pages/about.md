I am a research scientist at [Spotify](https://research.atspotify.com/){:target="_blank"}, with a PhD from TU Delft. My work spans information retrieval, recommender systems, natural language processing, and machine learning. I am passionate about building systems that connect people with content (and creators) by understanding their information needs and preferences. I am interested in the entire information-seeking process and in designing and evaluating systems that support it.

<!-- In this context, some techniques and topics that I've worked with are dense/generative recommendation & retrieval models, re-rankers, LLM-as-judges, alignment, explainability, negative sampling, synthetic data generation, knowledge distillation, user profile generation, and RAG. -->
