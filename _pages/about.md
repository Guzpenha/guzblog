I am a research scientist at [Spotify](https://research.atspotify.com/){:target="_blank"} with a PhD from TU Delft in conversational search and recommendation. My research interests include information retrieval, recommender systems, natural language processing, and machine learning. I am currently focused on recommendation and search problems. In this context, some techniques and topics that I've worked with are dense/generative recommendation & retrieval models, re-rankers, LLM-as-judges, alignment, explainability, negative sampling, synthetic data generation, knowledge distillation, user profile generation, and RAG.
